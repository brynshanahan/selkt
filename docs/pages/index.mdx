# Introduction

@selkt is a tiny store library built using classes and typescript.

It has a similar api to Zustand except that the .set command is always exposed by default.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install @selkt/core immer
```

If you are using React you can also install the React hook:

```bash
npm install @selkt/react
```

### High level

#### @selkt/core

The core package used to create stores.

The core package contains one type export:

- [`SelectableInterface`](./selectable-interface) - The base type that all Selectable classes `implement`

And two class exports:

- [`MutableSelectable`](./mutable-selectable) - The base Selectable class. Updates state with vanilla mutations (bring your own immutable library)
- [`Selectable`](./selectable) - extends MutableSelectable but uses immer to ensure state mutations are immutable

As well as [four utility functions](./utilities): `shallowEqual`, `shallowEqualArray`, `deepEqual` and `strictEqual`

#### @selkt/react

The React package contains one hook:

- [`useSelectable`](./usage-in-react) - A hook that returns a Selectable instance and subscribes to it's state changes
